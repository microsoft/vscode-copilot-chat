2. **Low-Level Design** - Detailed implementation guidance
3. **Component Reference** - Specific component documentation

### For Architects
Start with:
1. **Architecture Decision Records** - Understanding the "why" behind decisions
2. **C4 Diagrams** - System structure at multiple levels
3. **Integration Guide** - External dependencies and interfaces

## Document Conventions

- All diagrams use **Mermaid.js** format for easy rendering
- Code references link to actual source files in the repository
- Labels in diagrams use only alphanumeric characters and underscores
